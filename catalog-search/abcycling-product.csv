This ensures that both cups are lined up| keeping the bearings straight and the cup/frame interface level and precise. Machined aluminum cups house some of the finest bearings in cycling. Angular contact bearings are famous for their superior performance under axial loads| but they are also more durable than standard bearings in any situation| since wear is spread out over more of each ball. This makes them excellent for the heavy abuse that bottom bracket bearings endure. Installation of this BB will require a bearing cup press for the drive side cup| and a bottom bracket wrench for the non-drive side cup.

This combination puts more power where it's needed—up front—and saves weight where possible—out back. For riders who pride themselves on their braking technique| modulation and fine control are enhanced by the asymmetrical caliper set up of the Magura Trails. Basically a miniaturized version of their Supermoto Brake| the Trail's front four piston caliper is the same that comes on the Magura MT7. Make no mistake| these are not XC brakes| weighing approximately 70 grams more than the dual-piston calipers. However| they will allow you to rail all your favorite enduro tracks with confidence to spare. Initial inspection reveals that| unlike most four-piston MTB brakes| these use four pads per brake. This allows a third reinforcement arch to span the middle of the caliper| adding stiffness without hindering pad replacement in the least. Also| using four distinct pads increases clamping force and allows for better heat management. Since the separate front pads absorb more heat| the trailing pads are more effective than a typical two-pad set-up.  With a big ol' front caliper| Magura looks to make up weight elsewhere| and thus specced lever bodies similar to the MT8s. The weight savings begin at the carbon fiber lever| which shares ergonomics with Magura's old Marta lever blade—wide and flat against your finger—or old Hayes Mags. Instead of an aluminum or magnesium master cylinder body| Magura's Carbotecture—a carbon thermoplastic composite—allows precise construction for minimal mass. Additionally| the lever body is flippable| with a bleed port on each side| for right or left compatibility."|"Actual weight: 464 grams (front and rear calipers| hoses| levers) Pistons: 4 front| 2 rear Adjustability: Reach Materials: Carbolay lever| Carbotexture body| alloy one-piece calipers Caliper mount: Post Shifter/peripheral mount: Bar only Hose length: 850| 1945 mm Fluid: Magura Royal Blood Medium Included: Compression bushings| threaded barbs| caliper mounting bolts Part #: 2701213 Warranty: One year"

Reverb users cite the full hydraulic operation| including actuation| as a plus. Unfortunately| the necessity for regular bleeding and slow return speed have kept new users from coming on board. The Reverb B1 has changed all that. Previously| the Reverb's single O-ring seal on its internal floating piston (IFP) allowed air to sneak past. A redesigned IFP from SKF uses a double lip seal| practically eliminating the chance for air to enter the piston chamber. Updated valving has greatly increased the return speed| which is still adjustable at the remote to suit your preference. Additionally| wider bushing placement adds stiffness and durability across the entire line. This is the non-Stealth version| meaning the remote's hose attaches at the seatpost head| not the bottom of the seatpost. This post is best used for non-internally-routed frames.

Never mind... At this point everyone knows SRAM has surpassed the 11-step threshold and sent their drivetrain capabilities off the charts. With a SRAM XG-1295 Eagle 10-50 12 Speed Cassette on your rear wheel| there is no reason to run anything but a single chainring and say goodbye to the front derailleur for good. SRAM's X-Dome technology creates the impossible: a light| strong| long-lasting cassette. Nine cogs| the 14 through 42 tooth| are machined out of a single piece of steel billet. Stacked on top of the X-Dome are the 10 and 12 tooth steel cogs. Finally| the 50 tooth cog is machined alloy| since the load it bears is so light| and is riveted onto the nine-cog structure. While a traditional cassette slides over the freehub and is secured with a lockring that threads into the hub's outboard end| the XX1 Eagle cassette replaces the lockring with a cog. Thus| SRAM essentially integrated the lockring into the cassette body| which| of course| requires a special freehub to accept the threaded cassette.

Now| you can get a Shimano Di2 2x setup for less than half of that| without sacrificing the buttery-smooth shifting that made the XTR so awesome. Yes| trickle-down technology is a beautiful thing! Now that the excellent (and affordable) Shimano XT Di2 8050 Front Derailleur is available| you can expect to see electronic shifting becoming the norm rather than the exception. XTR Di2's most impressive offering is Synchronized Shifting| which takes the burden of front derailleur management out of your hands without losing the range advantages of a full drivetrain. Syncro Shift is an optional feature which allows the front derailleur to be controlled by the Di2 system. When shifting with the right-hand (rear) shifter| the rear derailleur decides what the most efficient gear combination would be based on chainline and your preselected power output profile. Then| if needed| the front and rear derailleurs shift into the optimum gear combination automatically. Syncro Shift can be turned off for manual control of both ends of your drivetrain| but why would you do that? Your unused front Di2 shifter is easily repurposed into a control for Fox iCD-equipped suspension. Easy| automated| and efficient—this really is the future! Shimano's 8070 front derailleur must be mated to an adapter compatible with your frame| so be sure to order the correct mount; high band clamp| low band clamp| or direct mount versions. Eliminate the vagaries of cable-actuated shifting from your rides| and step up to a Di2 system drivetrain for flawless drivetrain performance. Di2 delivers hassle-free| maintenance-free operation that's more powerful and accurate than anything possible from traditional systems."|"Actual weight: 137 grams Modular mounting structure Syncro Shift feature  25% more powerful shifting Optimized Di2 cage profile Automatic trim adjustment Two-year warranty Made in Japan Shimano part # IFDM8070"

Enlightenment begins with the knowledge and ability to control your own destiny| which is easy to accomplish with a set of SRAM Guide RSC Disc Brakes providing flow control. When our friends from the SRAM California Development Center in San Luis Obispo suddenly stopped meeting up with us for lunch rides| we knew something was up. After spying fancy-looking rotors and unfamiliar brake levers on their bikes| our curiosity was piqued. Turns out they were testing prototype SRAM Guide brakes| giving feedback on the brake you now see before you. It's no secret that Avid brakes with Taperbore master cylinder technology provide good modulation| but are a bit of a chore to bleed. Props to SRAM for recognizing this| and abandoning the design in favor of the new Timing Port Closure. With TPC| the Guide brakes maintain a consistent level of high performance| without requiring maintenance| for much longer intervals than Avid brakes. The Guide's improvements are not all about less frequent bleeds| however. Silent Centerline rotors (sold separately)| more usable braking power| and tons of grab deep into the lever throw are also hallmarks of the Guide brake. SRAM's Swing Link lever control linkage uses a lobe-shaped cam to fine-tune the pad contact power curve. As soon as the lever is engaged| the pads move. Thanks to the cam's shape| braking force is easily controllable all the way through the stroke for fatigue-free control. Pushing the pads together is a four-piston caliper| essentially an X.0 Trail model| which has never wanted for power and durability. Caliper mounting bolts| but not adapters| are included. The Guide brake does not include a rotor.

Height adjustable seatposts are a must for every trail and enduro bike| and the Rock Shox Reverb Stealth B1 is at the top of the heap.  With the dropper post market being dominated by two brands—Rock Shox with the Reverb| and Kind Shock with their multi-model line-up—dropper post users have ample time to get familiar with their preferred brand. Reverb users cite the full hydraulic operation| including actuation| as a plus. Unfortunately| the necessity for regular bleeding and slow return speed have kept new users from coming on board. The Reverb B1 has changed all that. Previously| the Reverb's single O-ring seal on its internal floating piston (IFP) allowed air to sneak past. A redesigned IFP from SKF uses a double lip seal| practically eliminating the chance for air to enter the piston chamber. Updated valving has greatly increased the return speed| which is still adjustable at the remote to suit your preference. Additionally| wider bushing placement adds stiffness and durability across the entire line. If your frame has ""stealth"" routing| which delivers the remote housing to the bottom of the seatpost| tucked neatly out of sight inside the frame's seat tube| then this Stealth version of the Reverb is what you need. Reverbs come with either a Left Hand Remote Mount (LC designation)| or Right Hand Remote Mount (RC designation). LC mounts on top of the bars on the left side.

Nevertheless| Renthal removes weight from their lock-on's by removing excess material from both the aluminum collars and the plastic core.  Renthal's Ultra-Tacky Treaction grips provide top performance in grip| comfort| and control| while lasting longer than you'd expect for such a soft compound."|"Actual weight 121 30 mm grip diameter 130 length (end-of-lockring to end-of-lockring) Ultra-tacky rubber compound  High tackiness| control| and comfort| medium durability  Non-removeable collars for 100% slip-proof performance Unmatched ease of installation and removal Made in Great Britain"

Height adjustable seatposts are a must for every trail and enduro bike| and the Rock Shox Reverb Stealth B1 is at the top of the heap.  With the dropper post market being dominated by two brands—Rock Shox with the Reverb| and Kind Shock with their multi-model line-up—dropper post users have ample time to get familiar with their preferred brand. Reverb users cite the full hydraulic operation| including actuation| as a plus. Unfortunately| the necessity for regular bleeding and slow return speed have kept new users from coming on board. The Reverb B1 has changed all that. Previously| the Reverb's single O-ring seal on its internal floating piston (IFP) allowed air to sneak past. A redesigned IFP from SKF uses a double lip seal| practically eliminating the chance for air to enter the piston chamber. Updated valving has greatly increased the return speed| which is still adjustable at the remote to suit your preference. Additionally| wider bushing placement adds stiffness and durability across the entire line. If your frame has ""stealth"" routing| which delivers the remote housing to the bottom of the seatpost| tucked neatly out of sight inside the frame's seat tube| then this Stealth version of the Reverb is what you need. Reverbs come with either a Left Hand Remote Mount (LC designation)| or Right Hand Remote Mount (RC designation). LC mounts on top of the bars on the left side. The mount can also be run upside down (under the bars) on the right side. RC mounts on top of the bars on the right side.

When that day comes| what we consider the pinnacle of performance won't be much different than the Magura MT7 Next Disc Brakes. Drawing on their extensive knowledge gained through designing and manufacturing the world's best motorsports brakes| Magura has created a brake with DH-level stopping power without a huge weight penalty. Basically a miniaturized version of their Supermoto Brake caliper| the MT7 Next shares several features with the big-bike stoppers. Make no mistake| these are not XC brakes| weighing approximately 70 grams more than the whisper-light MT8's. However| the MT7 Next's will allow you to rail heavy enduro and downhill tracks with confidence to spare. Initial inspection reveals that| unlike most four-piston MTB brakes| the MT7 Next's use four pads per brake. This allows a third reinforcement arch to span the middle of the caliper| adding stiffness without hindering pad replacement in the least. Also| using four distinct pads increases clamping force and allows for better heat management. Since the separate front pads absorb more heat| the trailing pads are more effective than a typical two-pad set-up.  All that extra stopping power available at the caliper is optimized with new and refined lever/master cyliner design. Moving the lever pivot 20 millimeters closer to the handlebar enables better modulation and ergonomics to help keep the power on all the way through the lever stroke. Carbotecture SL lever bodies are molded from Magura's thermoplastic/carbon fiber mixture—the same found on BMW motorcycles—creating an incredibly light weight and crash-resistant lever perch. Larger master cylinder pistons and increased mineral oil volume also contribute to the MT7 Next's improved braking performance.

All-day rides on heavy terrain| blasting descents after mellow climbs| or even racking up laps on the chairlift| the Race Face SixC 35 Carbon Riser Handlebar is up for whatever you are. As the handlebar standard evolves from a 31.8 to a 35 millimeter clamp diameter| the superiority of the larger diameter is proven daily. 35 millimeter handlebars are lighter and stiffer| a fact proven in laboratories and test centers of every major component manufacturer. The larger bars are so much stiffer that Race Face meticulously tunes down the stiffness to maintain comfort. The end result is a bar that is lighter| more resilient| and just as forgiving as the one you are used to. At a shocking 235 grams| the SixC 35 is light for even a carbon handlebar| and| as you trim the ends| which you will most likely do to some extent| they will only get lighter. Don't cut below 750 millimeters| though. At that point the stiffness to weight ratios are actually better on a 31.8 millimeter bar. Made from unidirectional carbon fiber| the choices of twenty and thirty-five millimeter rises means that there is a SixC 35 that will fit your set-up perfectly."|"Actual Weight: 235 grams Clamp Diameter: 35 mm Width: 820 mm Rise: 20| 35 mm Upsweep: 4 degrees Backsweep: 8 degrees Material: UD Carbon Warranty: Limited lifetime"

Instead of bolts and nuts| a bottom bracket lockring (which uses the ubiquitous Park BBT-22 bottom bracket tool) secures the ring to the arm.
