This is an example for a 3-Level Vega Treemap in Kibana

The Data represents a 3 level hirearchy. 

For this example: 

* The Top Level is and Organization in the field cf.org.name

* The 2nd level is Space in the field cf.space.name

* The 3rd and lowest level is App in the field cf.app.name

Each of the fields are present in each record.

In this case we are counting the number of events / hits.

This treemap should work for any 3 level metric / count. 

There are 3 files.

* sample-query.json
* vega-treemap-dsl.json
* vega-treemap-static.json

New Disk Map
* vega-telegraf-disk.json
